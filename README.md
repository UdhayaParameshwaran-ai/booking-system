## 📝 Project Description

The **Booking System Backend** is a full-featured RESTful API designed for managing service-based appointments, built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. It enables a seamless interaction between **Customers**, **Service Providers**, and an **Admin** who oversees the platform.

Customers can explore services, make bookings, and manage their appointments. Providers can create and manage the services they offer, while the Admin has complete control over user management and platform analytics.

The application supports **JWT-based authentication**, **role-based access control**, and a clean MVC architecture. It is built to be secure, scalable, and easily integrable with any frontend application like React, Angular, or a mobile app.

This project is ideal for use cases such as salon appointments, home service scheduling, doctor consultations, fitness sessions, and more.
